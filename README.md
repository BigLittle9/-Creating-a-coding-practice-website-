# Creating a coding practice website

## Setting-up the virtual environment
First of all, you will need to [set-up a virtual environment](/SET-UP.md) in the command line

## Creating the necessary files
Once you've set-up your virtual environment and installed the required libraries, you can go ahead and start adding files to the project directory. In this project, I have seperate HTML files for the login, register, question, and leaderboard page, which act as the front-end. You can also create your python flask application, which will act act as the back-end. Your file-tree should look something like this.

```
my_flask_app/
├── app.py
└── templates/
    ├── login.html
    ├── register.html
    ├── question.html
    └── leaderboard.html
```    
```python

h

print()

```
